    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
    To develop practical, research-backed strategies to enhance focus and retention in distracting environments, particularly for university students who often struggle with device addiction and sustained attention.

Our primary focus is on ADHD students in higher education who are experiencing attention challenges
while battling digital distractions.  We support students primarily by helping them establish routines during distraction-free time slots.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="section2">
    <h2>Methodology: Daily Routines</h2>
    <p>
    Our core strategy is a daily check-in and study routine that encourages the student to detox from distractions.  
    A typical session is in person with 2-3 students and 1 teacher:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Start by review of status and progress. Agreement on specific, achievable objectives for the session.
        </li>
        <li>
            Distraction-free block of focused work.
        </li>
        <li>
            End with students demonstrating progress.
        </li>
    </ul>
    The teacher helps the student by:
Difficulties in working memory or internalizing information: Creating visual schedules or checklists
Hard to structure their time and track progress: Using planners, calendars, and organizational systems
Overwhelmed by long list of things to do: Dividing large assignments into smaller, manageable steps
Not easy to stay on track and follow routines: Using visual cues and establishing ceremonies around routines
Problems with focus and productivity: Establishing specific time limits for tasks
Pproblems with distractions: Providing consistent support and distraction-free environments
Difficult to manage emotional regulation challenges: Teaching students how to identify and avoid triggers
Perceive lack of empathy from teachers and other students: Safe space with peers to discuss challanges

This method draws on research supporting structured support for executive function in ADHD students (Barkley, 2011) and accountability-driven learning.
    </p>

  <div class="section" id="section3">
    <h2>Challenges & Motivation</h2>
    <p>
    One critical challenge is keeping students engaged and willing to show up. Sessions can backfire if sessions feel punitive or reminds them of detention.
Extrinsic motivation alone (ie rewards and punishments) is often not enough for sustained engagement (Ryan & Deci, 2000).
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="section4">
    <h2>Solutions: Motivational Teaching Strategies</h2>
    <p>A skilled teacher adapts in real time, using subtle motivators and relationship-building to foster engagement:
    <ul>
        <li>Goal-Based Exit: Student may leave early if their goals are met—encouraging autonomy</li>
        <li>Scaffolded Support: Access to just-in-time help or curated resources if they’re stuck</li>
        <li>Growth Framing: Sessions framed as investment in future goals, not punishment</li>
    </ul>
    These align with Self-Determination Theory, emphasizing autonomy, competence, and relatedness for sustained motivation.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="section5">
    <h2>Solutions: Team-Based Approach</h2>
    <p>Our process is collaborative and iterative. Some of our experiments that have shown positive results are:
    <ul>
        <li>Automated progress reports and action items</li>
        <li>Tools for timeboxing and feedback</li>
        <li>All screens visible and shared during session</li>
        <li>Leverating peers to keep focused, ie students help each other maintain focus</li>
        <li>Re-assignment to study groups based on student efficacy and motivation</li>
    </ul>
    We believe multi-faceted support systems improve academic persistence in ADHD students (Anastopoulos et al., 2018).
    </p>

  <div class="section" id="section6">
    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>We’re exploring partnerships with educators, ADHD coaches, and tech developers to pilot this model at scale. If you’re interested in participating or testing a session format, we’d love to collaborate.</p>
